# bitwise-secp256k1
A naive implementation of elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication for the curve secp256k1, written in C

Oh, yeah, by the way, besides iteration counters and array indices, all operations are bitwise.
That means this code should be relatively easy to translate to an HDL like SystemVerilog.

This project was initially intended to be translated to TI-BASIC so it could run on old calculators like a TI-83 Plus, for security purposes. However, I got hit with an unexpected "ERR:MEMORY" menu.

This project is kind of cool, in itself, though.
I hope you like something about it ;)
